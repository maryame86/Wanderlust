# Wanderlust

Wanderlust is a travel site project
Weather and local venue/attraction information is retrieved from the Foursquare and Open Weather Map APIs when a city is searched.

Wanderlust also uses Twitter's type-ahead.js library and world cities data from datahub.io

The Wanderlust Project is an adaption of a Codecademy project from the Learn JavaScript course.
